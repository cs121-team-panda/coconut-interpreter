Coconut is a functional programming language that compiles to Python so Coconut programs can run on any Python interpreter. Since there has not been a standard online interpreter for Coconut, the goal for this project is to create a simple, elegant webpage that enables users to enter and execute Coconut code. 

# Background
Executing the user's code on the backend can pose security threats. For example, the user could use Cross Site Scripting or XSS, which attempts to have applications load a malicious script in the browser. This type of script can try access user's credentials data, get cookie information, modify settings, download bits, etc..

# Developers
